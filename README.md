# odin-recipes

# For this project I will be putting into practice all that I have learned up to this point through the foundations part of the course. The project is to make a basic recipe website. Throughout this project I will try to demistrate Git basics, Lists, Links and Images, and some other basic foundational tags, attributes, and elements.
